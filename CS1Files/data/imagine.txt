Imagine theres no heaven
Its easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today (ah ah ah)
Imagine theres no countries
It isnt hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say that Im a dreamer
But Im not the only one
I hope someday youll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say that Im a dreamer
But Im not the only one
I hope someday youll join us
And the world will live as one
